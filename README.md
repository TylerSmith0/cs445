Univ. of Pittsburgh -- CS0445 -- Data Structures

This is previous coursework from my CS0445 course.

# If you are a current CS 0445 student, **DO NOT** copy anything from this repository.

This is intended to show potential employers the work that I've done in my past.

I made a mistake my Undergraduate year in CS1501 where I helped a friend with code that I had written.
My friend was stressed out and asked for a copy of my code. Against better judgement, I couldn't say no, and I sent him my code.

Lo and behold, said friend copied the entire file word-for-word (even the bugs I knew that existed in it, which I proved to Dr. Garrison at the time) and submitted it.

Per Pitt's policy, both the sender and receiver of the message are in violation of academic conduct. It resulted in both of us failing the course, and I had to take the course again the next semester.

So, if it's down to the wire on this project, **DO NOT COPY ANY CODE YOU FIND ONLINE**. Trust me, it's better to just accept a poorer grade (while still getting partial-credit) and to have a chance at making it up on the next project than it is to risk failing.

# Please do the right thing, and good luck!
